# Convolutional neural network work sample scripts in Tensorflow and PyPorch

- This repo contains modified example work scripts implimenting Convolutional Neural Networks as a feature extractor in Tensorflow and PyTorch.

- These scripts are intended as examples of **Adam Morphy's** work with the Vancouver Whitecaps FC, and have been modified outside their original data pipeline.
